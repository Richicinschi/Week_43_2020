# Information about the exercise

The Jones family has set up the tent on a camping site. Itâ€™s hot and for the kids they want to fill a bath
with water. Father has two jerrycans, each having a volume of 12 litres. He is strong enough to walk
with the jerrycans to the nearest water tap and carry them back completely filled.
Write a program that asks how many litres of water is needed to fill the bath. You may assume
that this number is an integer. The program must print how often Dad must walk up and down to fill
the bath.
